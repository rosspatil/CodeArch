A very elegant and fastest way to build Micro-Services with Minimal code (Based on complexity).

Most of `no-code` solutions targets the non-technical people to build and test software products, and after certain limit they people give up because they won't be able to handle all other aspects of the software. Also, Writing code daily in repeatative manner makes technical people feels reduces the productivity and motivtion.

CodeArch is just a `Minimal Code` solution to build large scale web application for the technical people. You can write web applications by assembling various technical components (that only technical person knows).
